    <p>Centred in Hyde, our coffee shop is the best coffee shop on earth. 
        Come down and be served a piping hot cupa by a famously friendly staff!
        <br>
        Our Coffee is ethically sourced, and brewed to perfection by our barista, and the bread
        has been sourced by a local bakery, Best Bakery.
        <br>
        Above all though, we hope you have a nice, chilled time.
